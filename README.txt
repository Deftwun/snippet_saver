 ***Work in progress***
--------------------

A prototype code snippet app that I'm building for myself and plan on putting on the chrome web store. The plan is to make it function offline & sync your snippets to google drive so you can access them anywhere. 

Currently just uses local storage to save snippets as a single JSON object.

Uses ace code editor for syntax highlighting and features you'd find in most basic code editors.
